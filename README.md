# Vue.js Mini Projects

- `assets/` - Shared assets such as CSS and JavaScript files.
- `data/projects.json` - Metadata about each project (title, description, etc.).

  - Each project folder (e.g., `project_000/`) includes:
    - `index.html` - The main HTML file for the project.
    - `app.js` - The main JavaScript file for the project.
    - `main.css` - The main CSS file for the project.
